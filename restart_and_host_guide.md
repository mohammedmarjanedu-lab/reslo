# Reslo — Calculated FEM Application Startup & Connection Guide

This guide describes how to run the Reslo Frontend and High-Performance **OpenSeesPy Backend** locally, connect them, and expose the backend to the internet for public shareability.

---

## 💻 Part 1: Running Locally (Fast & Offline)

To run the application entirely on your local machine:

### 1. Start the Python Backend
1. Open a terminal (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or terminal of your choice).
2. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   py -3.12 backend/main.py
   ```
   *The backend will start running locally at **`http://localhost:8000`**.*

### 2. Start the Frontend
1. Open a second terminal window.
2. Run the Vite/Svelte development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *The frontend will start running locally at **`http://localhost:5173`**.*

### 3. Open the App in Your Browser
Go to **`http://localhost:5173`** to access the design interface. 
*The status indicator in the bottom-left corner of the panel will automatically turn green and show **OpenSeesPy Connected**.*

## 🌐 Part 2: Publicly Hosting & Sharing (Secure HTTPS Tunnels)

If you want to host the app so others can access it or if you want to connect a live deployment (like Vercel or Surge) to your local backend, use the automated tunnel script:

### 1. Run the Automated Tunnel Script
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start_tunnel.ps1
```

### 2. What this script does automatically:
1. Clears ports `8000` and `5173` of any active stale processes.
2. Launches the FastAPI backend.
3. Generates a secure, public **Cloudflare HTTPS tunnel** pointing to your backend (e.g., `https://xxxx.trycloudflare.com`).
4. Updates the `.env` file with this new URL.
5. Launches the Vite frontend.
6. Generates a secure frontend tunnel.
7. Prints ready-to-use shareable links in your terminal.

## 🔗 Part 3: Connecting Your Backend to Live Sites

If you are using the Vercel production deployment (`https://reslo-eosin.vercel.app`) or Surge deployment (`https://reslo-graph.surge.sh`), you must provide your active backend tunnel URL. 

### Option A: Query Parameter (No Redeployment Needed)
Simply append `?api=<your-backend-url>` to the frontend URL:
* **Vercel**: `https://reslo-eosin.vercel.app/?api=https://clerk-chest-allows-powder.trycloudflare.com`
* **Surge**: `https://reslo-graph.surge.sh/?api=https://clerk-chest-allows-powder.trycloudflare.com`

*The frontend will dynamically route all OpenSeesPy solver requests to your secure local tunnel.*

### Option B: Build-time Configuration (.env)
If you want to bake the URL permanently into the build:
1. Open the `.env` file in the root folder.
2. Edit or add the line:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-active-tunnel.trycloudflare.com
   ```
3. Run `npm run build` and redeploy.

## 🛑 How to Stop Everything
To cleanly terminate all running background processes (FastAPI, Vite, and Cloudflare tunnels) and release the ports, run:
```powershell
.\stop_tunnel.ps1
```
